compile with:

	g++ -O3 -mtune=native -pthread -fPIC -ldl -shared -o "libmallochook.so" mallochook.cpp

or import the folder in Eclipse and click on the compile button.
Launch your program with this command:

	LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/library /path/to/your/program 

then send a SIGUSR1 to it when you want a dump to be generated ('killall -s SIGUSR1 yourprogram').
Open up the Mathematica nootebok, modify the first line to match the path of the generated file, then evaluate it.

You should not strip your program, otherwise you won't be able to convert addresses to lines.
The notebook has been created and tested with Mathematica 8, I don't guarantee anything with other versions.
